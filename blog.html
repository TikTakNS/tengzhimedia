        <h1>7 reasons why China is the leader in Technology</h1>
        <h4 class="publisher">author: <i>June Andriamandroso</i></h4>
        <h2>Rare earths elements</h2>
        <p>They are incorporated into smartphones, wind turbines, MRI devices, specialty alloys, electric batteries, etc. Rare earths are in almost all chains of production. China provides more than 80% of the world production of the group of seventeen metals. The elements are not exactly rare, but China has found a way to limit the pollution caused by their exploitation.</p>
        <h2>Lithium-ion batteries</h2>
        <p>With very large lithium reserves and lower labor costs than Korea and Japan, China has become the world leader in the lithium-ion batteries that equip electric vehicles today. The country claims around 60% of the world's production capacity. Its specialists are CATL, which weighs more than 20 billion euros on the stock market, and BYD, which has Warren Buffet in its capital. CATL has decided to build a "gigafactory" in Europe, in the region of Erfurt, in Thuringia. BMW has already placed an order worth several billion euros.</p>
        <h2>Renewable energy</h2>
        <p>China is the world's leading country in electricity production from renewable energy sources. For several years, the country has been at the center of global supply and demand for renewable energy, leading it to account for about 40 per cent of capacity growth from 2015 to 2020. It was followed by Europe, the US and India. The four markets together accounted for 80 per cent of global capacity growth for the period, and are projected to increase that hold to 87 per cent between 2021 and 2026. China’s share jumped 50 per cent for the first time in 2020 amid a rush to finish projects before government subsidies were phased out. After exceptional expansion over the past two years, this rapid growth in China is expected to decelerate in 2022. Still, the country is expected to remain the industry leader over the next five years, accounting for 43 per cent of global renewable capacity growth, according to the IEA.</p>
        <h2>Space race</h2>
        <p>China heats up Space Race as China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation announced that it has planned more than 40 space launches for 2022, as well as six manned space missions, including with two Shenzhou spacecraft. China’s Tiangong space station is expected to be completed this year. China has made great progress in space programs as it had never conducted more than 10 launches a year until 2007. However, it has gained traction since then, launching 152 satellites in the past five years, more than any other country.</p>
        <h2>Patents</h2>
        <p>China was the biggest source of applications for international patents in the world in 2020 for the second consecutive year according to the U.N. The rate of increase was higher for China with a 16.1% year-on-year increase. The biggest single filer under this system last year was China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for the fourth consecutive year and second was South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.</p>
        <h2>Technology and innovation</h2>
        <p>Over the past four decades, no one could possibly match the pace or the extent of the change in Chinese life. What China has achieved in terms of scientific and technological advances is nothing short of a miracle. The country's scientific and technological advances leads in countless areas from renewable energy to 5G network, and high-speed rail to artificial intelligence (AI), and has numerous world-leading companies. Within the next five years, China plans to improve the new Nation system in a centrally planned market-oriented economy, achieve breakthroughs in core technologies, and improve the overall efficiency of its innovation system.</p>
        <h2>AI</h2>
        <p>AI is the newest brilliant, dazzling object on the technological horizon. It has grown very popular in today's globe. It's the simulation of human intellect in computers that have been programmed to learn and mimic human behavior. AI will have a significant impact on our quality of life as it develops. It has the potential to significantly boost the economy of a developed country. According to Western intelligence assessments, China, the world's second-largest economy, was expected to dominate in that sector, within the decade.In March 2016, an artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, beat a South Korean grandmaster at Go, an extremely complex and demanding Chinese board game. The five game series was watched by an audience of more than 280 million viewers across China. And that is how the country became an AI powerhouse.

        <h1>China Import and Export Fair</h1>
        <h4 class="publisher">author: <i>June Andriamandroso</i></h4>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The China Import and Export Fair was founded on April 25th, 1957. It’s held in Guangzhou every spring and autumn. It is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce and the People's Government of Guangdong Province . Hosted by the center. It is a comprehensive international trade event with the longest history, the highest level, the largest scale, the most complete variety of commodities, the largest number of buyers, the widest distribution of countries and regions, and the best transaction effect in China. It is known as "China's first exhibition". <br><br>The trade methods of the Canton Fair are flexible and diverse. In addition to the traditional sample-seeing transactions, online trade fairs are also held. The Canton Fair mainly focuses on export trade, but also does import business. It can also carry out various forms of economic and technological cooperation and exchanges, as well as business activities such as commodity inspection, insurance, transportation, advertising, and consulting. The Canton Fair Complex is located on Pazhou Island, Guangzhou, with a total construction area of 1.1 million square meters, a total indoor exhibition hall area of 338,000 square meters, and an outdoor exhibition area of 43,600 square meters. The fourth phase of the Canton Fair Complex will be put into use at the 132nd Canton Fair (that is, the 2022 Autumn Fair). After completion, the Canton Fair Complex will have a total exhibition area of 620,000 square meters and will become the world's largest exhibition complex. Among them, the indoor exhibition area is 504,000 square meters, and the outdoor exhibition area is 116,000 square meters.</p>
        <h2>Exhibitors</h2>
        <p>The Canton Fair is held in three phases, each of which has a different scope of exhibitors. <br><br>
        Phase 1: Large machinery and equipment, small machinery, bicycles , motorcycles , auto parts, chemical products, hardware, tools, vehicles (outdoor), construction machinery (outdoor), household appliances, consumer electronics, electrical and electronic products, computers and Communication products, lighting products, construction and decoration materials, sanitary equipment, import exhibition area.
        <br><br>Phase 2: kitchen utensils, household ceramics, craft ceramics, home decorations, glass handicrafts , furniture, weaving and rattan iron handicrafts, garden products, iron and stone products (outdoor), household items, personal care appliances, bathroom supplies, clocks and watches Glasses, toys, gifts and premiums, holiday supplies, local products (newly included in the 109th session).
        <br><br>Phase 3: men's and women's clothing, children's clothing , underwear , sportswear and casual wear, fur leather and down and products, clothing accessories and accessories, home textiles , textile raw materials, carpets and tapestries, food, medicine and health care products, medical equipment, Consumables, dressings, sports and travel and leisure products, office stationery, shoes, bags.</p>
        <h2>Reasons to attend</h2>
        <p><strong>It’s free!</strong><br>
        The Canton fair is co-hosted by the Ministry of Commerce of China and the government of Guangdong Province and their priority lies in the sheer magnitude of business generated by these events, not in raising entry fees. <br>
        Therefore, the fair is free of charge as long as you pre-register before you go. On the spot registration is also available, but costs $20. Save yourself the unnecessary expense by registering online.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s foreigner-friendly!</strong><br>
        The Canton fair remains predominantly export-oriented. Given the expected influx of foreign buyers, the hosts often go out of their way to make things easier for the bewildered visitors. Signposts in English will guide you around, and English-speaking volunteers will be available throughout the major transport routes to and from the fair to help ese your passage. <br>
        Most booths will have at least one English-speaking representative to avoid communication barriers, although you can also arrange for an interpreter at the show if you need one. <br>
        These extra amenities also make the Canton Fair a convenient gateway into the world of Chinese business for the uninitiated outsider. If you’ve been dealing with manufacturers and suppliers only on Alibaba, maybe now is the time for you to venture out there yourself and make new relationships in person.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s well-organized!</strong> <br>
        Given the sheer size of the area and number of potential vendors, it would be a waste your time and effort to just walk around hoping to find what you need. You can access the complete listing of exhibitors at the official Canton Fair website and set up meetings with vendors or manufacturers you’re interested in beforehand. While accidental discoveries are definitely part of the charm of the Canton Fair, keep your eyes on the prize and give yourself the best possible chance of success.</p>
        <p><strong>It will open new doors</strong> <br>
        It is always a good idea to build a personal relationship with business partners, especially in China. It is difficult to overstate the role that personal rapport plays in the cost, quality and timeliness of delivered products. We have heard so many stories about Western companies finding a sharp decline in defective product deliveries from the same vendor after having met them in person. Over the course of a few days, you can meet several manufacturers and discuss terms like MOQs and timelines on the spot, look at samples of their work and maybe even visit their factories, all before finally closing the deal. Such an arrangement will help avoid the most common pitfalls of manufacturing in China and open new doors that you previously weren’t even aware of.</p>

        <h1>Chinese nutrition tips to adopt this year</h1>
        <h4 class="publisher">author: <i>June Andriamandroso</i></h4>
        <p>Let’s welcome 2020 with new resolutions. How about a healthy lifestyle?
          Here are a few Chinese healthy tips you can try.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Yin and Yang </h2>
        <p>Chinese think man’s health depends on the harmonious link he maintains with nature. To preserve this balance, he stays close to nature. One way to stay connected is to follow the seasons, by taking advantage of the benefits offered by the fruits and vegetables of each season. It’s simply the principle of Yin and Yang. Avoid eating raw fruits in winter as they are yin (cold) in nature and the body needs to be kept warm in winter.</p>
        <h2>2.	No junk food: peace of mind</h2>
        <p>The worst diet you can have is too much sugar and not enough fiber. The abuse of sugar has a harmful effect on the body and the mind, it creates inflammation and in the long run on all kinds of chronic diseases: concentration problems at school, aggressive behavior, depression, weight gain, acne, sleep etc. How you ask? our intestines are our 2nd brain, they contain more neurons than our brain! Imagine if we fill our body with bad things, it will affect not only our body but also our emotions, our mental abilities.</p>
        <h2>3.	Good fat and beauty</h2>
        <p>Our body can neither manufacture nor replace them. But our energy, the renewal of our cells and the beauty of our skin depend on it. <br>
        40% of our energy intake should come from lipids (fats), but where are they found? The best sources are: <br>
          •	Fish: salmon, tuna, herring, sardines <br>
          •	Chicken, eggs <br>
          •	Cooking oil. In Traditional Chinese Medicine each oil has its own purpose, sesame oil is said to improve circulation, warm the body, and nourish hair.</p>
        <h2>4.	Eat with your eyes</h2>
        <p>In Chinese medicine, the color of each food is associated with an organ. Liver is associated with the color green, so our liver loves green vegetables. As for our kidneys, they are associated with black, hence the presence of black beans in the Chinese diet. Red fruits are good for the blood and the heart. The white is associated with the lung, which will benefit from the consumption of pears. Yellow is associated with the spleen... The more foods of various colors we eat, the more we balance our diet to preserve the health of all our organs.</p>
        <h2>5.	Give fermented food a try</h2>
        <p>The fermentation process removes plant defenses and adds good bacteria to the gut. It's common in Southeast Asia to ferment the soybean into miso, natto, tempeh, and tamarai, which removes most of the toxic properties. Fermenting cabbage to create kimchi and fermenting tea to make kombucha is also a regular practice. Both supply beneficial bacteria to the gastrointestinal tract, similar to the probiotic pills we use in other parts of the world.</p>
        <h2>6.	Take a break</h2>
        <p>When the body digests it secretes insulin. If it remains in a state of digestion for a long time, this causes a disorder in the spleen, and therefore fatigue. To put the body at rest and detoxify it, think about fasting. Skipping a meal once a week is pretty good, contrary to what we are always told. Or more moderately, eating earlier in the evening and therefore fasting longer until the next morning is a gentle way of fasting. If you can’t bear the hunger, water can help to take up space in the stomach, leading to a feeling of fullness.</p>
